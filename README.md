Control your heater from your FritzBox, if you dare...

This project emulates a room thermostat for a central heating unit.
It monitors a set of AVM FritzDect 301 (intelligent radiator valves)
and signals the heater to turn on or off via a simple relay circuit.

Since we are dealing with mains voltage and probably gas-powered
heating systems, you should not even think about using this contraption
unless your are a licensed electrician and/or certified HVAC technician.

Seriously, don't.
